# NSSS-android
Android Implementation of NOSS!
The implementation is mostly borrowed from Android Implementation of noname-kill, which in turn is mostly made of imported libraries. The whole app was probably a template for running JS files downloaded from somewhere. If it was not copied, goddamn if that is not impressive.

Anyhow.
Although this is an android app, able to install, run, uninstall and all, this is really just a browser window dedicated to downloading, opening, and running NOSS.
As such, the biggest changes are download links, permissions (not that I need more, it's just lingering change from previous debugging), name, icons and backgrounds. There are a lot of other things I can change, but I have refrained from customization as the functionality of the APK, most of the time, lasts all of 3 seconds, with almost every function making invisible changes.

Since I have changed everything I have set out to change, it's likely these files are not going to see any changes in the years to come.
