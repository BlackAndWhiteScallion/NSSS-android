# Night of Shooting Stars!
New game currently under development.
It is a Touhou fan game, which took its inspiration from the popular chinese table top game, Three Kingdom Kill. 
At this point, the game plays nothing like its original inspiration source. 
A physical version of the game has already finished development, and is currently undergoing playtesting.
The framework of code in this repository comes from the no name kill 1.9.2.2.

I will put up a link to the physical copy of the game soon.
