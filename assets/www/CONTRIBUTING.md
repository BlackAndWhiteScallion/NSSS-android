Merging straight into master is big no-no.

Please draft pull requests with comments.
Just a brief list of what you have changed, and what you have in progress is a good enough comment.
Any pull request without comment is immediately going out the window with zero tolerence.
Including stuff like updating one line on a single file.

If you are adding new functions, please add comments in the file as to how they work, and what parameters they require.

I will merge it after a proper code review, but I cannot check this everyday, so please wait warmly with some tea.
